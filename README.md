# air-hockey
it is my attempt to learn how to program. I am trying to make air hockey as it mentioned in the title.

In this game there are 2 paddles and a puck. To move each paddle drag it with mouse. It supposed to be played on multi-touch screen.

For playing this game Python3 and Kivy 1.10.0 are required. Just run the app in any Python IDE.

While writing this program Pong Game Tutorial (https://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html) was used.

In further development it's neccesary to:
  1. write normal function of bouncing of a puck. Unfortunately, I didn't realized how to make it. Consider friction force in way like self.ball.velocity -= const*self.ball.velocity, 
  2. draw beatiful pictures for better game invironment,
  3. make user-friendly interface with menu,
  4. make a bot for playing alone (for example, paddle moves to the location of puck with constant speed),
  5. reformat as .apk file,
  6. of course, download to play market.
  
It could be done, I think in 2-3 days. You, my Indian friends, could make each point for 2 weeks. It will take accurately 3 month. Good luck!
